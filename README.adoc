# Indoor Navigation

A Indoor Navigation Application showing the shortest path from one node to another.

## Technologies and Frameworks used

* Java 8 or higher
* Apache Maven 3.5.3 or higher
* Quarkus
* Eclipse Mosquitto
* Neo4j

## Quickstart

* Clone the repo: https://github.com/sonjacao/indoor-navigation.git or download it
link:https://github.com/sonjacao/indoor-navigation/archive/master.zip[here] as a the zip file

* Open a terminal and run the following command to start the Neo4j Database:
----
docker run --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 --env 'NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/secret' --env 'NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=["graph-algorithms"]' --env 'NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted=algo.*' neo4j:3.5.14
----

* To start Mosquitto you have to open another terminal and execute `
----
docker run --rm -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto
----

* In order to run the Indoor Navigation Application you have to run
----
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
----

Now the service should be running on port 8080.

## Usage

This application allows you to create, read, update and delete nodes as well as their connections (relationship)
and displays the shortest path from a specified start node to an specified end node. +
You can use these services link:http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/[here].

To use the desired service you must click on it so it opens up and then click on the _Try it out_ button.

In some cases you need to specify a node name to pass it as a query parameter or the values of a node. +
Once you are done you can execute the query else you can cancel it as well.

If you want to calculate the shortest path from one node to another you must specify the names of a start
and an end node. +
For creating a relationship you must specify the names of two nodes, too.

### Node structure

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "isHidden": true,
    "name": "4ahitm",
    "type": "FLOOR",
    "x": 120.45,
    "y": 1250.67,
    "z": 12.55
  }
]
----

* *isHidden* specifies whether a node is visible (e. g. rooms) or not (e. g. nodes in front of a door)
* *name* defines the name of the node (e. g. Cafeteria, Meeting Room 1)
* *type* represents if the node is `FLOOR`, an `ELEVATOR` or a `STAIRS` node
* *x, y* and *z* are the coordinates of the node

## Example

After you have created some nodes and connected them your Neo4j database could look like this:

image::assets/indoor-navigation-swagger-05.png[Neo4j Database]

For getting the shortest path from _Information Stand_ to _4ahitm_ you can
link:http://localhost:8080/path/shortest?start=Information%20Stand&end=4ahitm[send a request] in your browser. +
Or you can use _GET /path/shortest_ of the Swagger UI under the tag *path*.

The result body looks like this:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "node": {
      "name": "Information Stand",
      "type": "FLOOR",
      "isHidden": false,
      "x": 1250,
      "y": 80,
      "z": -1722
    },
    "distance": 0
  },
  {
    "node": {
      "name": "Floor 1.1",
      "type": "FLOOR",
      "isHidden": true,
      "x": 2590,
      "y": 150,
      "z": -1722
    },
    "distance": 1341.8271484375
  },
  {
    "node": {
      "name": "Floor 1.3",
      "type": "FLOOR",
      "isHidden": true,
      "x": 1290,
      "y": 200,
      "z": -1722
    },
    "distance": 2642.788330078125
  },
  {
    "node": {
      "name": "4ahitm",
      "type": "FLOOR",
      "isHidden": false,
      "x": 2728,
      "y": 80,
      "z": 1320
    },
    "distance": 6009.68701171875
  }
]
----

* The first object is the specified start node.
* The last object is the specified end node.
* The key *distance* shows you how far it is from the start node to another.
The total distance is displayed in the last object, here it is `"distance": 6009.68701171875`
